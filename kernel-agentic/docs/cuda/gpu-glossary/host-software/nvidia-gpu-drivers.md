title: What are the NVIDIA GPU Drivers?
---

The NVIDIA GPU drivers mediate the interaction between host programs or the host
operating system and the GPU device. The primary interfaces to the GPU drivers
for applications are, in order, the
[CUDA Runtime API](/gpu-glossary/host-software/cuda-runtime-api) and the
[CUDA Driver API](/gpu-glossary/host-software/cuda-driver-api).

GPU [Kernel Module](/gpu-glossary/host-software/nvidia-ko).
